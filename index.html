        <h1 class="txt-header"> WHO WE ARE </h1>
        <p style="text-align:center"> WE ARE a task force service built to protect marginalized
          identities, centering the black trans woman experience.
          Black trans women are our most marginalized community,
          facing physical + sexual violence at an epidemic scale.
          They receive little support from a movement that has is meant to
          center the lives of the black community. </p>

    <div class="container contents">
      <h1 class="txt-header"> WHAT WE WANT </h1>
      <p> Collective liberation requires us to recognize that we are as strong
        as our most marginalized. </p>
      <ul id="wants">
      <li> We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our Black Trans Community. </li>
      <li> We want full employment for our black trans women. </li>
      <li> We want an end to the robbery by the capitalists of our black and oppressed communities. </li>
      <li> We want decent housing, fit for shelter of black trans women. </li>
      <li> We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of
          this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us
          black trans history and our role in the present day society. </li>
      <li> We want all Black trans individuals to be exempt from military service. </li>
      <li> We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER of Black Trans women.</li>
      <li> We want freedom for all Black trans women held in federal, state, county and city prisons and jails. </li>
      <li> We want all Black people when brought to trial to be tried in court
        by a jury of their peer group or people from their Black Communities,
        as defined by the Constitution of the United States. </li>
        <li> We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and

        <h1 class="txt-header"> WHAT WE DO </h1>
        <p> Here's a list of services we provide: </p>
        <ul id="services">
          <li>End-to-end encryption app:</li>
          <p> Once someone is accepted into the task
            force, they will receive secure access to the app. This app will
             include services that will be on the receiving end of alerts that are described below. </p>
          <li> Rescue Rides:</li>
            <p>If the user feels that the situation they are
                currently in is putting them in danger, they can send an alert through
                the TSAP app that will alert 5 nearby task force drivers in the
                area to come and driver the user to whatever location is most safe for them. </p>
          <li> Accountability Buddy:</li>
          <p> When the user signs up for the app, they
          will be given the chance to register an accountability buddy who will
          be given secured access to the app. If the user enters a situation that
          they feel may endanger them, they will be able to “check in” when
          they enter the space, log how much time they plan to be in the space,
          an option to send their accountability buddy their location and
          “check out” once they leave. If the allotted time passes and they have
          not checked out of the space, they will receive three alerts before
          their accountability buddy is alerted on the app. </p>
          <li> Transformative Justice + Collective Liberation Workshops </li>
          <p>These workshops are for Task Force Members and are facilitated by community organizers
          required by the task force and open to community members with the
          intention of long term safety for black trans women.</p>
          <li>Connections with Lawyers who are members of Task Force. </li>
          <li> An Alternative Option for 911 where the user can be
            transported to medical help and their preferred name and pronouns
            can be shared to medical care by the task force member. </li>
          <li> The services we provide include smart watch, exclusively
            for black trans women. This watch will be designed with apps that
            allow for the user to have services by the task force readily
            available to them.  For safety purposes, each watch will
            have a different design and a unique set of combinations of
            physical aspects.
