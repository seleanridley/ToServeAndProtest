# Artist Statement

To Serve and Protest is a statement and a call to action. The conditions in which black trans women are forced to exist in on a daily basis are unacceptable and below basic standards of what any human being in the US should endure. If any of us truly believe that collective liberation is possible, we must understand that all our struggles are connected and that we are as powerful as our most marginalized community. This project is meant to bring awareness to the epidemic of violence  that has gone under the radar and outright ignored by individuals/institutions of power. The task force’s “wants” listed in the project are a reframed version of the Black Panther Party’s Ten Point Program Manifesto centered around the lives of black trans women in hopes that it will make the user question why they were needed before, why they’re needed now and imagine a future in which these are possible and can come into fruition. The statistics that are presented in this piece I hope are jolting pieces of information that you bring home to your friends and family for discussion.

As a black trans individual, this piece means a lot to me as it is the community that I’ve found a home in. For the past year, it’s been extremely hard to watch the deaths of my trans sisters collect and to feel as if we’re screaming in protest into an empty void. We watch time and time again as the lives of black cis men are centered, even though they are not the only victims of police violence and are not at the most risk. In a time where even the Black Lives Matter movement does not draw attention to the voices and lives of black trans individuals, we have no choice but to amplify our own voices.

I hope that when people engage with the piece, they ask less of “Why Should We?“and more of “Why not?”. I call for viewers to ask themselves whether they would sign up for the task force, and/or whether they would share it with friends.
