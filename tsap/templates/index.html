        <h1 class="txt-header"> WHAT WE DO </h1>
        <p> Here's a list of services we provide: </p>
        <ul id="services">
          <li>End-to-end encryption app:</li>
          <p> Once someone is accepted into the task
            force, they will receive secure access to the app. This app will
             include services that will be on the receiving end of alerts that are described below. </p>
          <li> Rescue Rides:</li>
            <p>If the user feels that the situation they are
                currently in is putting them in danger, they can send an alert through
                the TSAP app that will alert 5 nearby task force drivers in the
                area to come and driver the user to whatever location is most safe for them. </p>
          <li> Accountability Buddy:</li>
          <p> When the user signs up for the app, they
          will be given the chance to register an accountability buddy who will
          be given secured access to the app. If the user enters a situation that
          they feel may endanger them, they will be able to “check in” when
          they enter the space, log how much time they plan to be in the space,
          an option to send their accountability buddy their location and
          “check out” once they leave. If the allotted time passes and they have
          not checked out of the space, they will receive three alerts before
          their accountability buddy is alerted on the app. </p>
          <li> Transformative Justice + Collective Liberation Workshops </li>
          <p>These workshops are for Task Force Members and are facilitated by community organizers
          required by the task force and open to community members with the
          intention of long term safety for black trans women.</p>
          <li>Connections with Lawyers who are members of Task Force. </li>
          <li> An Alternative Option for 911 where the user can be
            transported to medical help and their preferred name and pronouns
            can be shared to medical care by the task force member. </li>
          </ul>
